REST with Angular
============

Getting started and understanding [AngularJS][1]

Its trying to consume a REST endpoint with POST method, where its needed that "request header" must be customised. AngularJS does not allow customising headers for $resouce, [here is a reference][2]. I am using [$http][3] module here to do the same.
